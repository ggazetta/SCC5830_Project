### Abstract:
Images with patterned noises can be difficult to process or even to visualize. These patterns are high-frequency noises that scatter throughout the images. With that said, this final project aims to remove sinusoidal patterns from a set of images. In order to remove those patterns, it is necessary to convert the images to the frequency domain through Fourier Transform in order to visualize and cancel out those high-frequency regions with specific filters that cover the specific high-frequency areas in the image, resulting in an image with no pattern and little to no blur.


#### Application: 
Image Restoration - Pattern and noise removal

#### Inputs: 
corrupted images with patterns (sinusoidal noise).
For the input, I've researched and chosen the following images with sinusoidal patterns on them for further removal.

#### Outputs: 
Processed Images without patterns.

### Methodology

* Step 1: Finding images with sinusoidal noise.
* Step 2: Applying the Fourier transform in these images and observing their behavior in the frequency domain.
* Step 3: Creating a stop-band filter to apply gaussian, Butterworth and ideal knotch filters.
* Step 4: Plotting the resulting images and comparing the methods.
