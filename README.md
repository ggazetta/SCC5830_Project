### Abstract:
This final project aims to remove sinusoidal patterns from images. To do so, it is necessary to convert these images to the frequency domain through Fourier Transform in order to visualize and cancel out these high-frequency regions with specific filters.

#### Application: 
Image Restoration - Pattern and noise removal

#### Inputs: 
corrupted images with patterns (sinusoidal noise).
For the input, I've researched and chosen the following images with sinusoidal patterns on them for further removal.

#### Outputs: 
Processed Images without patterns.

### Methodology

* Step 1: Finding images with sinusoidal noise.
* Step 2: Applying the Fourier transform in these images and observing their behavior in the frequency domain.
* Step 3: Creating a stop-band filter to apply gaussian, Butterworth and ideal knotch filters.
* Step 4: Plotting the resulting images and comparing the methods.
